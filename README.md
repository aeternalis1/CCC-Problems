# Contest-Problems
My solutions to some official contest problems. (CCC,CCO,IOI etc.)

Some python solutions are in py2, others py3.

It is not guaranteed that all the solutions are correct. These all pass the official test data (or at least the ones on the various judges used), but there may be certain edge cases or such on which they fail.
